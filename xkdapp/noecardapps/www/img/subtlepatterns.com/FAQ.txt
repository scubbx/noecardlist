Frequently Asked Questions
http://subtlepatterns.com/about/

Can I use the patterns in themes I make and sell on ThemeForest (or similar sites)?
Yes you can, but you have to credit subtlepatterns.com in your theme description or source code.

Is it OK to use your patterns in commercial projects?
Yes it is, as long as you credit subtlepatterns.com some where in the project.

Can I publish your patterns for download on my site/blog?
You can link to subtlepatterns.com, but not directly to the patterns.

Can I make CSS3/coded versions of your patterns?
Yes, but please link back to the original pattern (ex: http://lea.verou.me/)

Can I sell your patterns in my texture pack?
No, absolutely not. The patterns are free to use and download, but you are not allowed to re-sell the patterns and make money off other peoples work.

If I make a new pattern based on one of your patterns, can I publish it as my own?
I guess you could, but being nice about it and crediting the original author is always a nice thing to do.
